    Compute the Correlation Immunity (CI) of an S-box.
    
    Correlation immunity measures the degree to which the output of an S-box
    is statistically independent of subsets of the input bits. An S-box is said
    to have correlation immunity of order m if there is no nonzero correlation
    between any m or fewer input bits and any output bit.
